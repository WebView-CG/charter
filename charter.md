# [DRAFT] WebViews Community Group Charter

This Charter is work in progress. To submit feedback, please use [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/WebView-CG/charter) Issues where this charter is being developed.

## Goals

The WebViews Community Group aims to reduce the issues arising from the use of software components (typically referred as `WebView`s) that are used to render Web technology-based content outside of a Web browser.

## Scope of Work

In the first phase of work that this charter covers, the WebViews Community Group will:
* identify representative use cases of where WebViews are being used,
* identify the issues that arise from these usages,
* determine whether these issues can be addressed through improvements to the Web Platform, the surrounding ecosystem (e.g. documentation, testing frameworks) or through other mechanisms,
* raise awareness about the impact of WebViews for Web technologies in relevant communities (e.g. existing W3C groups)

The group will not publish Specifications on topics other than those listed under Specifications above. See below for [how to modify the charter](#amendments-to-this-charter).


### Out of Scope

Specific development of technical proposals to mitigate identified issues are out of scope of this charter; the group expects to [amend its charter](#amendments-to-this-charter) with a specific list of mitigations it would seek to address in a second phase of work, based on the analysis conducted as described above.

## Deliverables

### Non-Normative Reports

* WebView use cases and limitations: a document describing the type of use WebViews fulfill and the challenges they create in distributing content and applications built on top of Web technologies.

## Dependencies or Liaisons

* [MiniApps Ecosystems Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/miniapps/): MiniApps rely extensively on WebViews
* [Web Application Security Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2011/webappsec/): the Web Application Security Working Group oversees the security model applied to Web content in browsers, which impacts Web technologies used outside of that context

## Community and Business Group Process

The group operates under the [Community and Business Group Process](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/). Terms in this Charter that conflict with those of the Community and Business Group Process are void.

The [W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/) applies to participation in this group.

## Transparency

The group will conduct all of its technical work in public. If the group uses GitHub, all technical work will occur in its GitHub repositories (and not in mailing list discussions). This is to ensure contributions can be tracked through a software tool.

Meetings may be restricted to Community Group participants, but a public summary or minutes must be posted to the group's public mailing list, or to a GitHub issue if the group uses GitHub.

## Amendments to this Charter

The group chairs can propose the group adopts an amended charter, editing the text using the Decision Process described above. The decision on whether to adopt the amended charter is made by conducting a 30-day vote on the proposed new charter. The new charter, if approved, takes effect on either the proposed date in the charter itself, or 7 days after the result of the election is announced, whichever is later. A new charter must receive 2/3 of the votes cast in the approval vote to pass. The group may make simple corrections to the charter such as deliverable dates by the regular group decision process rather than this charter amendment process. The group will use the amendment process for any substantive changes to the goals, scope, deliverables, decision process or rules for amending the charter.
